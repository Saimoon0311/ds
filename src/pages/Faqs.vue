              We understand it can be difficult in some legal matters to articulate the full scope of the services to be provided to the client.

              We suggest you try to set out, in as much detail as possible, the services you will provide to the client, as closely as you would do if the client had contacted you directly through your website or as you would be required to do ordinarily on a costs disclosure form. Remember, the information you provide through our platform is not intended to replace your disclosure requirements to clients under applicable legal profession laws — you should still issue a separate costs disclosure form to your client as required.

              Our position on discounting is that it is up to the individual lawyer to decide whether they will entertain such a request. We understand that some lawyers will be opposed to reducing the perceived value of their work, whilst for other lawyers discounting is routine practice. If a client requests a discount, you should be clear whether this is accepted or not in your messages through the messaging system. This is because, as you are unable to amend your proposal (for an explanation, see [why can’t I amend my proposal?]), the agreed discounted estimate needs to be reflected in the costs disclosure and costs agreement you provide to the client once they have accepted your proposal. If the client insists on your proposal reflecting the agreed discount, please <router-link to="/contact-us">contact us</router-link> and we will manually reflect the proposal.

              Once you have submitted a proposal, you are not able to amend it. You can only withdraw the proposal, in which case you are prevented from submitting a new proposal for the same job (as this would have the same effect as amending it). We prevent amendments to proposals for 2 main reasons:
              <br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>we want to ensure clients have the certainty that the terms of a proposal they have seen do not change; and </li>
                <li>we don’t want to encourage bidding wars between lawyers by allowing clients to ask lawyers to match better offers they have received.</li>
              </ul>
              
              Whilst this may be inconvenient, we hope that you will understand that we made this decision in the interests of maintaining the integrity of the platform and the legal industry.

              There might be instances when, upon being provided with the details of an accepting client, you run a conflict check and identify a conflict of interest. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to act for the client and they will need to engage an alternative lawyer. Please <router-link to="/contact-us">contact us</router-link> and tell us that you are unable to act for the client, so that we can reinstate the client’s job on the Simplawfy platform.

              To avoid the potential of harassment of clients, and clients abandoning the platform before accepting a lawyer’s proposal, we intend that clients and lawyers communicate exclusively through the platform, until a client has accepted a lawyer’s proposal. Once that happens, we will exchange the contact details of the client and lawyer, so that they can communicate further off the platform.

      <ol class="mb-5">
        <li>The messaging system is intended for clarification around jobs in order for the lawyer to have enough information to submit a proposal, or for the client to have enough information to accept a proposal.</li>
        <li>The messaging system should not be used to continue the conduct of a matter after the client has accepted a proposal — this communication should be continued externally.</li>
        <li>The messaging system should not be used to harass the client or send follow up messages.</li>
        <li>The messaging system should not be used to transmit confidential or private information. Attachments and links are not permitted.</li>
        <li>Clients and lawyers should not use the messaging system to exchange contact details — these will be exchanged once a client accepts a lawyer’s proposal. Any messages that include ‘@’, ‘gmail’, ‘outlook’, ‘hotmail’, or ‘.com’ should be flagged with the warning message reminding about this.</li>
